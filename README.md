# smscsvxml
A simple program to convert SMS data from the CSV format used by phonecopy.com to SMS Backup &amp; Restore XML backups

This is a simple windows forms routine to convert SMS data export FROM the phonecopy.com website to the XML backups used by the app SMS Backup and Restore (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.riteshsahu.SMSBackupRestore)

.XML backups can be put in google drive and imported back via SMS Backup.

I created this program because I wanted to transfer SMS data from an old Symbian phone to a new Android smartphone.
So I signed up to phonecopy, synced the messages, exported SMS data into a CSV file, and recreated the XML backup using the XSD available on the SynTech website. Less boring than using Ovi Suite again after all these years, I guess.

If it can be useful to somedoby, do what you want with this!
